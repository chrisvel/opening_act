# OpeningAct

Do you use Sinatra often? Are you tired of creating the same boilerplate files every time and haven't had the time to automate your system yet? Well then this is the gem for you. OpeningAct creates the template files you need for your Sinatra application so you can start developing in moments.

OpeningAct was inspired by Bundler's gem template and Rails. The template files were partially inspired by [zapnap's sinatra template](https://github.com/zapnap/sinatra-template).

## Installation

To install OpeningAct, you just need to run this command on your machine:

    $ gem install opening_act

## Usage

Once you install OpeningAct on your machine, you will have access to the executable `opening`. To create your sinatra template, just run it on your command line:

    $ opening

OpeningAct will prompt you to provide a name for your project and your preferred test framework (Rspec or Minitest).

You can also pass in 



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
